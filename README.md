# UEFA EURO 2016 in tweets.
From June to July the **UEFA EURO** championship was played in France.       

The goal of this project was to collect the tweets being made during the matches of the final stage (quarterfinals on).       

 Once collected, they were analyzed (text and meta-data) to discover which events were the most relevant for the users.    

 This repository has only a sample of the code used to achieve this (both __python__ and __ipython notebook__).    

 The matches analyzed were:

 * Poland vs Portugal 1-1 (3-5 p)

 * Wales vs Belgium 3-1

 * Germany vs Italy 1-1 (6-5 p)

 * France vs Island 5-2

 * Portugal vs Wales 2-0

 * Germany vs France 0-2

 * Portugal vs France 1-0 (e.t.)
